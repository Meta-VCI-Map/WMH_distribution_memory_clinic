# WMH distribution memory clinic

This repository contains code to replicate our work related to the distribution of White Matter Hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin in memory clinic cohorts. 

## Typical spatial distributions of white matter hyperintensities on brain MRI in a large multicenter memory clinic cohort
Replication code for our manuscript "Typical spatial distributions of white matter hyperintensities on brain MRI in a large multicenter memory clinic cohort" _(submitted)_ is provided in [this Jupyter Notebook](WMH_atypical_patterns.ipynb). Replication data can be obtained from https://doi.org/10.34894/FYL9ID.
